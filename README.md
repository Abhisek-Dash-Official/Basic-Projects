# 📁 Basic Projects – Step 1 of My Journey
📌 This repository contains my early beginner-level projects, created shortly after completing my 12th grade.

These projects were built before I even started college, demonstrating my curiosity and self-motivation to learn programming and development independently. Despite not having formal college-level training or guidance, I explored and practiced concepts by building small projects such as basic web apps, command-line tools, and simple games.

This collection reflects my foundational journey into programming and lays the groundwork for more advanced projects I plan to build in the future.

🛠️ `More polished and advanced repositories will be NOT ADDED in this Repo as I continue to grow as a developer.`
